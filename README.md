# RNN_Transcription_Project

The goal of this project is to train an RNN model to transcribe text. So far, the preprocessing functions have all been implemented. They utilize audio processing techniques such as MFCC, and text tokenization to prepare the training data for use in training the model.

This project is still in progress.

List of unfinished tasks:

1. Research on effective model implementations and parameters to ensure successful training
2. Testing the train model both with built in functions, and in simulation with sample data
